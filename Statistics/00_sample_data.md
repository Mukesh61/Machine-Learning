# Sample Data (Sample and Populations)
If we want to predict elections outcome. then we can ask some voters randomly let's say 1000 voters from different area. based on this sample result we can predict the outcome. 

- we cannot ask everyone full population, as it will be very expensive and time consuming process.
- by asking sample few people from different group might, help us to get result close to the actual result.

# Type of Data
- Nominal data: like number or name just t shirt number/name of player might not say much about skill of player. These kind of data is nominal data.
- Ordinal data: rank or scale of 1 to 10. these kind of data give relative information.
- Interval data provide equal differences. Fahrenheit temp. difference between 10 to 20 is same as 20 to 30. 0 F don't mean it starting, it is just somewhere in a scale. let's say your home is at -125 then place A is at O, then place B 50, place C at 100. now we cannot say that distance of place C is twice of place B. as starting is not 0 but -125.
- ratio data: this include meaningful 0. in this case 50 is half of 100. as 0 is begening. or from your home place A is 50 and place is 100. your home at 0 meaningful zero point starting point so we can say place A is helf of place B.

## The way logic work is you never accept a hypothesis. You either reject H0 or don't reject H0 based on data.
you and your friend discussing on 1 point. better to make hypothesis
h0 - null hypothesis like coin is fair and out of 200 toss, we will get 100 head and 100 tail.
h1 - it is baised- we will get more head then tails. 

now perform the analysis and reject these hypothesis.
Type 1 error: if you reject h0 but you should not.
Type 2 error: if you don't reject h0 but you should.
